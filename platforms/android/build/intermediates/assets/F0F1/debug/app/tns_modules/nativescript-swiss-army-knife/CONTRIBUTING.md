#Contributing guidlines

### this is a living document so I'll be updating it occasionally.
Please follow these 7 simple rules to make the PR process as smooth as possible.
I don't have a ton of free time, and I do this for fun.

 1. Always start a new branch of the latest version of master
 1. Before making a pull request, pull from master to avoid merge conflicts.
 1. Please don't override existing functionality, unless Your fixing a bug.
 1. Try to follow the existing coding style to the best of your ability in the project so that changes are seemless.
 1. If you're adding new functionality please make it optional and so it doesn't start unless the user wants it.
 1. If your developing on Windows or Linux please mention in your PR, so someone can test on iOS.
 1. Don't hesitate to ask any questions.
